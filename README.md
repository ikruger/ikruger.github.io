Hello! My name is Ilene! I'm currently a freshman in high school and am thrilled(and somewhat shocked, I will say...) that you decided to check out my website and even more thrilled that you downloaded the files! I'm working on uploading a CSS stylesheet to make everything easier to use (it is a bit disorganized. I know.) Regardless, I'm so excited. I built this website for a school project and it is still a work in progress. I'll always be adding more and more things to it so come back and check! This was my first experience ever using Github or hosting a website outside of Codepen or a learning website (Khan Academy and Code Academy, etc.). It's definetly a learning curve so if you find any problems with the code or have any questions feel free to contact me. If you download this and plan to use it as a template, please reach out to me at ilene.kruger@icloud.com. I'd most likely be thrilled but it does have some sensitive stuff (it was for a school project) so it would be nice to keep track of who has my files. Thanks!!
