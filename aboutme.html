		<span class= "about-me-paragraph">My name is Ilene Kruger and I am a freshman at The Madeira School in McLean, VA.<br>
			 Through classes at Madeira, my academic interests have grown from a mild interest in math <br>
			to an extreme passion for world history, which has widened my worldview so much. Going to an all-girls school has <br> 
			given me the ability to use my voice to speak up about things I am passionate about, such as feminism and <br>
			environmental issues. This portfolio is coded entirely by me with some help from various <br>online tutorials. 
			It is a  sprawling showcase of my schoolwork and my interests. I hope you look around!</span>
